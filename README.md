This is a simple health/reachability tester for HTTP(S), TCP, ICMP pings, and DNS queries.

See `examples` dir for K8S deployment & configuration examples

## Motivation

I wanted a super simple way to check if a lot of things are online in various senses of the word "online". Is my homebuilt DNS server down? Is my homelab K8S cluster down? Etc.
